The dominant clusters cluster on the left side (community resources, sustainability, education, housing) and right side (infrastructure, urban planning, safety, tech culture), with open-source AI and gardening forming bridges across this divide. Large gaps exist for unhoused residents, seniors, immigrant voices, and BIPOC perspectives—suggesting the current discussion reflects primarily employed, housed, English-fluent community members. The spatial layout suggests a community with strong grassroots organizing capacity but uneven access to institutional resources.","metadata":{"total_posts":158,"processing_time_ms":491117,"stance_labels":["practical-gardener-struggling","practical-gardener-confident","community-garden-seeker","community-garden-insider","urban-planning-advocate","pragmatic-alternative-seeker","urban-agriculture-enthusiast","cautious-rule-follower","pragmatic-urban-farmer","eco-enthusiast-organizer","cautious-sustainability-seeker","eco-enthusiast-confident","plant-sharing-enthusiast","practical-gardener-accepting","plant-novice-self-aware","plant-expert-confident","concerned-parent-undecided","bilingual-education-advocate","safety-focused-parent","tech-enabled-parent","pta-drama-observer","experienced-problem-solver","education-skeptic-nuanced","budget-conscious-parent","anti-pressure-education-advocate","resource-seeking-parent","pta-process-advocate","logistically-constrained-parent"],"theme_labels":["gardening-in-fog","crop-selection","local-adaptation","succulent-gardening","low-maintenance-plants","local-knowledge","humidity-management","succulent-care","community-gardens","access","waitlists","community-coordination","urban-density","planning-policy","alternative-resources","accessibility","backyard-chickens","urban-farming","community-engagement","urban-regulations","compliance","practical-advice","composting","environmental-sustainability","community-cooperation","urban-concerns","pest-management","environmental-practice","plant-swaps","community-sharing","urban-gardening","succulent-propagation","plant-selection","local-resources","houseplants","plant-care","beginner-frustration","low-light-plants","beginner-advice","school-choice","education-selection","parental-stress","language-immersion","education-quality","child-development","public-safety","playground-maintenance","infrastructure","tutoring","academic-support","affordable-services","parent-organizations","community-conflict","decision-making","incident-reporting","municipal-services","curriculum-limitations","individual-differences","after-school-programs","affordability","resource-awareness","student-wellbeing","pressure-culture","educational-access","collective-decision-making","community-benefit","after-school-care","childcare-logistics","school-services","risk-management","sustainability","bureaucracy","traffic","bike-lanes","parking","police-response","technology","theft-prevention","data-driven-decision-making","housing","financial-stress","building-projects","urban-development","legal-rights","tenant-rights","displacement","community-resources","commute","technology-enabled-services","regulatory-concerns"],"root_assumption_labels":["Local climate significantly constrains which plants can thrive","Plant species should be matched to local conditions","Local microclimate (humidity/moisture) fundamentally differs from desert conditions","Community gardens are valuable resources with limited access","Community gardens serve neighborhood residents and information flows through coordinators","Urban density creates need for shared green spaces;
